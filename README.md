### Git
Git keeps track of the history of all the things you've ever worked on and working on on the computer. Git doesn't have a problem with multiple people working on the same file, and is also much more sophisticated compared to things like Google Docs. Git is version control software.

### Github
Github is a web service where you can sign into it and do Git things on a website, Github runs the software of Git from behind the scenes. Kind of like a social network but specifically for projects that are managed by Git.

### Repo
Repo is a project that can have multiple files attached to it. Repo names can't have spaces so it'll automatically put a dash where the spaces are. A README is a special type of file in a Repo that basically explains to you what the Repo is about. You can create new files, and there are many types of file formats, including .txt that Git and Github tracks for you.

### Commit
Commit is basically saying that you're gonna make a change to the file and then commit it. When commiting new file, it creates the file and shows it in the Repo. You can have notes added when you commit files. Commit hash is an idenifier for a specific commit that you do, found in history as a string of characters and numbers.
